# Pig Poop Emu Alpha v0.01

This is an alpha version of a SNES emulator. It's currently in development and not fully functional.

## Current Progress

- **Basic structure:** The emulator is split into modules (CPU, PPU, APU, memory, etc.) for better organization.
- **ROM loading:** ROMs can be loaded and parsed.
- **CPU execution:** The CPU can execute basic instructions.
- **GUI (in progress):** A simple Tkinter GUI allows for ROM selection, starting, and stopping emulation.

## Next Steps

- **Complete PPU implementation:** Finish rendering graphics.
- **Implement APU:** Add sound emulation.
- **Improve GUI:** Add more features and make it more user-friendly.
- **Emulation accuracy:** Test and improve the accuracy of the emulation.
- **Add more features:** Implement save states, cheat codes, etc.

## Known Issues

- **Incomplete emulation:** Many games may not run correctly.
- **No sound:** Sound emulation is not yet implemented.
- **Rudimentary GUI:** The interface is basic and may lack features.

## Running the Emulator

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x and the required packages installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Place your SNES ROMs in the `roms` folder in the project's root directory.
3. Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal.
4. Run the emulator:
   ```bash
   python -m snes_emulator.main
   ```

## Disclaimer

This emulator is for educational and testing purposes only. Please only use ROMs of games you legally own.
